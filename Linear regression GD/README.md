# Linear Regression GD
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values. It fits a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values. Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that gradually adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the cost function.
