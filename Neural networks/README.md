# Neural Networks
Neural Networks, also known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), are computational models inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes called neurons, organized into layers. Neural Networks learn to perform tasks by adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between neurons. This process, known as training, involves feeding the network with labeled examples and updating its parameters using optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent.
